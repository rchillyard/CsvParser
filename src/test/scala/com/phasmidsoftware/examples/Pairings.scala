/**
  * Pairings is an example application which reads a CSV file and outputs JSON.
  * The file is assumed to be in ~/Documents/Partnerships.csv and the output will be in a file with the same
  * base name but extension .json
  *
  * The pplication which reads a CSV file of player names, then forms partnerships by pairing
  * the odd-numbered lines with the even-numbered lines.
  * As written, it is expected that
  * the input file has a header row with at least "first" and "last" columns.
  * However, it is easy to switch to a programmed header--see the definition of TableParserHelper.
  *
  * Each pairing is then converted to a Partnership (as required by the Shark Bridge Teacher Console).
  *
  * The resulting partnerhips are then output as Json, by first converting the Iterator[Partnship] to a Array[Partnership].
  *
  * You can override the name "Partnerships" by specifying an appropriate command-line argument.
  *
  * NOTE: see Pairings project for an improved version of this.
